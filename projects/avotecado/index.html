            on, I also became the team manager. As with any team-based project, there was a need for someone
            to manage the team, i.e. assign tasks in an efficient manner, make certain decisions, etc.
            I tried to do so in a way that was considerate of people's lives outside of the project.

                Avotecado is a web application that helps people keep track of municipal politics. Using
                Avotecado’s political aggregation toolkit, users can follow elected officials, track how they vote
                on issues, and uncover voting patterns that can get lost in the daily news cycle. Avotecado's goal
                is to foster engagement beyond election cycles by making political data accessible, easy to
                understand.
            </p>
            <p>
                We chose municipal politics for 2 reasons:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    High degree of apathy; Municipal politics has some of the lowest
                    percentages of political participation (vs. provincial or federal).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Party Discipline; The parliamentary form of provincial and federal politics leads to
                    politicians almost always voting along party lines. Municipal politics offers an
                    opportunity to see what types of issues cause politicians to vote against party lines.
                </li>
            </ol>

    <div id="goals" class="columns bottombrd">
        <h3 class="column is-4 no-margin-top">Goals of Avotecado</h3>
        <div class="column is-8">
            <p class="no-margin-top">
                One goal was based in technology. This project was a process in learning to
                build a web app. We set out to learn relevant web technologies while making a prototype of something
                we felt could be useful.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other goal was based in accessibility of knowledge. We wanted to try to make something that
                would help people understand local politics and be able to participate/be involved, even if only
                tangientally through being informed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tracking politicians is difficult once they get elected. Elected officials often do and say things
                that are not the same, and we want to help users track the day-to-day decisions politicians make and
                provide tools that allow users to see patterns in voting behaviour (if and when they exist).
            </p>
            <p>
                Legislation/Votes are also difficult to track. It is difficult to parse through the legal language
                that comes with legislation and their pathways to becoming law are difficult to follow. We wanted to
                present these items to average voters in ways that are easily understood, both qualitatively and
                quantitatively.

            <p class="no-margin-top">
                We took a problem-solving approach to this project. As previouly noted, in municipal politics, it is
                difficult to follow politicians/legislation and there is a higher degree of apathy.
                With that in mind, we set out to design a solution to fix this.

                        Throughout the initial ideation of avotecado, we initially came up with some feature and
                        user flow
                        ideas (Figure 1). We practiced an agile based design-iterate methodology. We would come up
                        with some
                        ideas, run them by each other, talk through it, and then discard/evolve the idea.

                Figures 2, 3 and 4 show the initial idea we had for the homepage. We wanted to have a landing page
                that asks the user for their location and then proceeds into a selection page (Fig. 5). The
                selection page would either be the most recent city votes, a politician selection page, or a party
                selection page. The default 'home' would have been settable by the user. This idea was scrapped due
                to
                time-constraints, we ended up focusing on Vancouver.

                We wanted to keep the UI consistent through both mobile and desktop.
            </p>
            <p>
                We discussed alternate ideas as a team and settled on something a bit different than the proposed
                sketches.
                We drilled down on the actual required functionality and deemed features like the city picker as
                unnecessary for the minimum viable product.

                that addressed the problems in the <a href="#goals">goals section</a> at a foundational level,
                but numbers and visualization are only part of the whole picture. There is a deeper level of
                analysis required.

                Generating the political analysis from the data we aggregated turned out to be a significantly more
                complex problem than we would have been able to tackle with 1. our skill-set at the time, and 2. the
                amount of time we had.

                I dealt with quite a few challenges during this project.

                    Our iterate-test-reiterate process was a difficult but rewarding experience; it cemented the
                    need for throw-away prototypes.

                    As project manager, I had to deal with unforseeable real life issues that popped up and pivot
                    accordingly. I had to work around
                    a personal issue that prevented a larger time commitment from one member. The way I did this was
                    to
                    give that member tasks they
                    were super comfortable with and knew they could get done quickly for the initial data gathering
                    phase of the project.

                Many lessons were learned while doing this project.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    The number one lesson was to temper expectations. We wanted to do *too* much with too little
                    time,
                    ability, and data.
