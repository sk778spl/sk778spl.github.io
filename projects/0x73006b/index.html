            <h3>Summary</h3>
            My personal portfolio in which I post completed work that I am able to share.
            <h3>How</h3>
            The site was built purely in html/css.
            <h3>Why</h3>
            I built it <em>without</em> using javascript solely for speed. The lack of javascript,
            the minimal use of images and minimal css lead to VERY fast loading times (and thus metrics like
            First Meaningful Paint are achieved with ease), with the slowest load time being the font.
            <p/>

            I purposely designed the website to look "barebones", and some <em>might</em> call it web brutalist.

            Either way, the minimalist appearance creates a situation in which on-screen text is deemed meaningful,
            and with the weights that I use, hopefully draw a user's eyes in the proper manner
            (granted, the typography is quite large, which may be an issue).

            I added some feedback on link hover â€”

            The website will be a continuous project, and the next iteration may become vastly different.
