                The EVSE Dashboard is an operational dashboard built to provide pertinent,

            With more and more electric vehicles (EVs) being bought, and more parkades (Canadian for parking
            garage/lot) installing electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), otherwise known as EV charging
            stations, there is a need for parkade management to see the goings-on of the EV charging stations — an
            operational dashboard that would allow them to see how much energy they're using, how many
            chargers are being used at a given time, the amount of money they're making, and more.

            Our main target demographic was parkade managers and admin staff. We had a line on one parkade manager,
            but with limited access to them. We did an informal, unstructured interview with a university parking
            manager and got a list of wants, needs, and pain points of the products he used.

            To get a better understanding of the current product landscape, I took a look at competitor products
            and took note of what could be improved upon. The main takeaway was that there were improvements to
            be had in the level of complexity, and how quickly information could be accessed.

            After doing some user research and product research, and understanding our constraints
            (i.e., what data was available to us), we created a list of requirements.
            Beyond the required default charts to display, we had some basic usability requirements.
            People needed to be able to view relevant data in a quickly and easily digestible manner.
            The default layout should be in an order where more consistently updated information is
            put in a position where it'd be viewed first.

            <p>
                To develop a working prototype meant that I needed to design the front and back end systems. The
                front end was created using React and Redux, with Material UI and Recharts to speed up the visuals.
                Many custom components were required to be made, but having a foundation sped the process up
                considerably.
            </p>
            <p>
                The back end was created using Node/Express as the main backbone. I wrote many SQL queries to
                interact with the database Socket.io was used to connect the two and implement real-time updating.
            </p>
            <p>
                As with many modern software projects, we took an agile approach to the project. My coworker (who
                was working on another project) and I instituted a Bitbucket and JIRA combination for a
                significantly better issue/task tracking and workflow experience. Implementation for the most part
                was straightforward on the client-side.

                Documentation and project structure can often be overlooked in keeping a project maintainable. I
                carefully designed the project to have an understandable structure—with a balance of nesting folders
                and ease
                of access.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the front end, components, utilities, and the store were put into appropriate folders.
                This was also done on the back end. Code was written and designed to be easily accessible and
                legible.

                I spent quite a bit of time documenting the project in a detailed manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                I documented how to use the custom components that I created, what the various functions do, and the
                general structure of the project. Where applicable, I added accompanying diagrams — e.g a diagram
                explaining the component split between the navigation area, and the 'chart area'. I also explained
                the conceptual aspects of the project and included my thought processes for certain decisions, as
                well as the design patterns I used.
            </p>
            <p>
                Accompanying documentation was created for the database side of the project, in which I explained
                the pertinent concepts, tables, keys, and issues of the (very large) database. I also documented the
                SQL queries that I wrote, explaining what each procedure does, how code blocks work and areas where
                I feel there could be some improvement in the future.

            Every project comes with some form of challenge. The EVSE Dashboard was no different.
        </p>
        <h4 class="column is-4 no-margin-top no-margin-bottom">1. An Undocumented Database</h4>
        <div class="column is-8 no-margin-bottom">
            <p class="no-margin-top">
                An undocumented database was the main source of issues. With a lack of documentation and a complex
                design,
                work on the project would have stagnated and many of the required features would not have been
                possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                However a combination of reading the documentation, carefully analyzing the different fields and
                looking for patterns, communicating with my manager and the company managing the database,
                I ended up being able to:
            <ol style="margin-left: 1vw;">
                <li>Create custom SQL queries for the project.</li>
                <li>Create documentation for the relevant parts of the database.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
        </div>
        <h4 class="column is-4 no-margin-top no-margin-bottom">2. User Permissions</h4>
        <p class="column is-8 no-margin-top">
            There were also access issues—our user accounts were not given full access to the database. This created
            issues for some of the real-time updating plans we initially set out to have. However, real-time
            updating was one of the main features of this project and so I figured out a way around this access
            issue and implemented it.

            Learning a new technology can be challenging, but also rewarding. During this project, I learned how to
            use web sockets, and I learned the associated design patterns with web sockets.
