            This project explores Formula1 car improvements from 2000-2020.
            My team and I look at the improvement (or worsening) of cars over the years through
            power-to-weight and lap times — this is done through interactive charts which visualizes
            the change. The project is styled using F1's branding guide.
            We implemented an interesting view: an animated head to head lap based on sector
            times for 2014 and 2019.
            <br/><br/>
            We also got in the CPSC 436V hall of fame for this project!

                    Each data set had some form of preprocessing.

                <p>
                    We started by putting our first data set (the F1 World
                    Championship set) into a MongoDB instance and found it was an immense number. We filtered it down
                    to seasons from 2000 to 2020 and then threw it into a python script that Lydia and I wrote.
                    This python script computed average lap times. We noticed that there was some race data missing
                    between 2000-2003, and so we had to manually fill in that data on a Google docs Sheet
                    (and then re-run our script).
                </p>

                <p>
                    The F1 car list data set was pre-processed entirely in python that I wrote. It was a scraper that
                    would pull data from a (thankfully) standardized table that each car entry had on Wikipedia. Some
                    data was missing due to the proprietary nature of almost everything in F1, and for that, we tried
                    our best to fill it in reasonably (through searching the internet or using estimated numbers).
                </p>

                <p>
                    We initially collected data from Kaggle for this, and then we filtered the data so only the tracks
                    we supported (i.e. used between 2000-2020) are left. Furthermore, the data is combined/merged so
                    that a JSON object has all 3 sectors we need for a given track/year. We manually updated the JSON
                    output to include 2014 data from the FIA website; the reason for this is that we could better
                    illustrate the difference (mostly the improvement) of the cars when comparing 2014 and 2019.

                During this project, I learned <em>a lot</em> about project management, development,
                setting and re-defining goals as necessary.
            </p>

            <h4 class="no-margin-bottom">Evolving Viz/Technical Goals</h4>
            <p>
                Every visualization went through some level of changes, some more significant.
            </p>

            <h5>Changes to Mechanical Changes Viz</h5>
            <p>
                We expanded this visualization with one more chart. In its original form, this
                chart was simply a scatterplot of the cars and 2 line charts. The final version
                has the same overall parts in that it has a scatterplot and line charts, but
                they now interact in a way such that one of the line charts (power:weight) acts
                as a filter for the scatterplot (and the vehicles it displays).
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also a jitter on the scatter plot. This helped remove some of the
                occlusion of data in the overview of the scatterplot. It <em>does</em> make
                the data a little less accurate, but being able to see the actual points was
                decided to be more important, and the actual numbers are available in the tooltip.
            </p>

            <h5>Changes to LT1 Viz</h5>
            <div class="columns">
                <p class="column is-6 no-padding">
                    In terms of viz design, this was changed from a stacked scatter plot to a small
                    multiples visualization. This change allowed us to remove large amounts of occlusion,
                    create a clean aesthetic look, and visualize missing data in an interesting way.

            <h5>Changes to LT2 Viz</h5>
            <p>
                We were originally going to do a standard barchart but we decided to do a stacked
                barchart to visualize the sector times better; it represents the part-to-whole
                relation better.
            </p>

            <h4 class="no-margin-bottom">For Next Time</h4>
            <p>
                Overall, I'm happy with the project. However, the amount of time we spent filling
                out data... it was... inordinate. So having a well sorted data set would be the
                main thing to address for the next personal viz project.
