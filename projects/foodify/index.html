                Foodify is a case study performed to learn a systematic approach to interface design. We implemented
                task analysis, and various analytic and empirical evaluation methods in an exploration of a
                food/grocery
                purchasing app interface.

            <p>
                We chose to explore a food/grocery purchasing app interface. This interface would allow a user to
                create a grocery list based on recipes or menus provided from a limited number of sources
                (e.g., spreadsheet, popular recipe sites, a built-in database) and then purchase items from said
                list.

            <p>
                This was a design exercise, so our goals were to make a well researched, well thought out interface.

    <div class="columns is-multiline bottombrd" id="research">

        <div class="column is-12">
            <p>
                We created personas of potential users of the app.
            </p>
            <p>
                We performed our initial user research through controlled observations and interviews. We created a
                coding sheet and this enabled us to quickly affinity diagram and plan/analyze our findings as a
                group.
            </p>
            <p>
                We made low-fidelity prototypes, with which we did some task walkthroughs to get a gauge of issues with
                user
                flow. We then made a high-fidelity prototype, we recruited participants to go through it and we then
                interviewed them about their thoughts.

    <div class="columns is-multiline bottombrd" id="requirements">
        <h3 class="column is-4 no-margin-top">Requirements</h3>
        <ol class="column is-8">
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Users can turn any inputted recipe into an ingredients list.
                </strong>
                <br/>
                Though this is a black box, being able to convert a recipe found online or from a recipe database to
                an ingredients list is the first step in creating a final grocery list.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>

                <strong>
                    Users can easily cross check ingredients they already have at home and ingredients they need to buy.
                </strong>
                <br/>
                Instead of the user doing calculations themselves on the grocery list to figure out the items they
                need to buy, this gives users a grocery list based on their logistical needs.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Users can find different brands and/or substitutes for ingredients and add it to their list.
                </strong>
                <br/>
                For example: if a user doesn’t want to use tomatoes in their recipe they can substitute in red bell
                peppers.<br/>
                This gives users a more personalized experience and allows for additional customization and
                flexibility.
            </li>
            <br/>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Users are alerted of products with common food allergens.
                </strong>
                <br/>
                By taking into consideration the food allergies listed on the user’s profile, users can save time by
                not
                having to personally check the recipes for potential food allergens. This requirement allows for
                efficiency
                in the shopping process, as well as ensures users’ safety.

            <p>
                Sam is a lactose intolerant college student trying to learn how to cook. Recently, he’s been
                finding recipes by watching YouTube videos. Sometimes he finds it too tedious to pause and
                rewind the video each time he misses an ingredient or a step. He wants something that translates
                a video into a recipe, which will provide him with the list of ingredients needed for the dish.
                He
                then
                checks what ingredients he has at home and tries to cross-check it with the recipe in order to
                produce
                a grocery list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, because he is saving money, Sam wants to compare prices between brands of the same
                product and put the cheaper option on his grocery list. Sam also wants to easily find a
                substitution if the recipe calls for a dairy product, and add that substitution to his grocery
                list instead.

                Martha is a single mother of 2. She wants a quick and easy way to turn recipes into a grocery
                list. Instead of spending a long time browsing for a recipe online, Martha wants a bunch of
                recipes ready for her to choose from. She wants to save the recipes that her and her children
                liked. However, she wants to be able to edit the grocery list once she selects on a saved or
                liked recipe, since the ingredients she has at home might differ from the previous time she went
                grocery shopping for the same recipe. Martha typically decides what to cook for dinner
                while on her lunch break at work. The grocery store is on her way home from work, so she wants
                to be able to order her groceries during lunch and then pick it up after she is done work.
                She usually makes dinner after she drops her kids off at their after school lessons on the same
                day.

            The team brainstormed and considered workflows by implementing informal layouts of the interface in
            Figma. Like the mock up made in XD, the Figma mock up allowed for understanding how users might move
            from subtask to subtask. The next step was to focus on feature visibility and aesthetic
            considerations
            through whiteboarding, allowing for ideas to emerge from the group. The paper prototype was an
            integration of the Figma prototype and whiteboarded ideas.

                After doing cognitive walkthroughs, we evaluated the good and bad of the two paper prototypes as
                well as approaches.
            </p>
            <p>
                We found that both had an intuitive user flow, going from screen to screen in a sensible way, with
                menus that made sense. Both had good, uncluttered interfaces. We found that PP2 also had a lot of
                safety
                checks to make sure the user hasn't made any mistakes.
            </p>
            <p>

                Both PP1 and PP2 had issues which needed to be addressed. We found that PP1 had some issues with
                signifiers—we found that PP1 had an erroneous signifier in how we used radio buttons instead of
                checkboxes (an error made on transitioning from idea to paper) and PP2 had a missing signifier on
                how to use the swipe affordability. PP1 missed out on dietary restrictions — this is likely due to
                the task
                example differences (Martha's story made no mention of allergens or dietary restrictions). This
                immediately stood out to us and showed how important diverse personas can be. With PP2, we found
                that there were too many nested screens.

                With all the information gathered from our initial paper prototyping, we set out to create a high
                fidelity prototype in Figma. We decided to limit our scope to what we identified as the key tasks
                that users would want, and need, to complete using the interface. In short, we wanted at least the
                following:

                We recruited 7 undergraduates to be participants in our user evaluation. They all fit our basic
                requirements of having some level of expertise with online shopping. We aimed to understand how
                efficient and understandable the interface was for users. With our prototype, we wanted people to
                save time, be accounted for in regards to diverse needs and have an enjoyable time while using
                it. With that in mind, we created and had our participants run through 2 tasks:

                    From our evaluation, we noted that:<br/>

                    - There are problems with how the ingredients list and checkout page were laid out. There were areas
                    that more intuitive signifiers could have been added for users to more efficiently update/remove
                    items from their ingredient lists.

            <p>
                Throughout this project, I learned a lot about HCI.
            </p>
            <p>
                By following a pre-design ⇒ early-design ⇒ mid-design ⇒ late-design development pattern, I learned a
                lot about going from concept to prototype and the overall process of creating a usable design.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the course of the project, I learned a lot about the importance of re-iteration informed by
                feedback (evaluations, heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthroughs, etc.) in user-centered design.
                Going through feedback and evaluation results as a team helped us aspects of our interface that we
                may not have thought about had we not iterated on the design through task based walkthroughs and
                participant evaluations.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project was a great case study in putting theory to practice, and learning the tools.
